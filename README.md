## term-weather

### Description

term-weather is a small script that outputs weather in three default locations: London, UK, Sheremetievo Moscow  Airport (code SVO) and Cherepovets, Russia. The script uses the API of the `wttr.in` Web service. The locations are easily editable in the `main.py` file.

### How to install

You need Python 3 to execute this script. If Python 3 is not yet installed then download it from http://www.python.org for your operating system and install.

### How to launch

`python3 main.py`

If you use a *nix-based operating system, you can do the following in your terminal:

`chmox +x main.py`

After this you will be able to execute the script by typing `./main.py` in your terminal (as long as you are in the script's directory).

### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers dvmn.org.
